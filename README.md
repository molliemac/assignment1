Your challenge is to create a drop down menu like you would see in the navigation of most websites. You can use CSS and Javascript but there are bonus points for using only CSS ( don't feel bad if you can't do it with just CSS). You can use any CSS frameworks or Javascript libraries you want, the only requirements are;

	1. It must work on Safari, Firefox and Google Chrome ( bonus points if it works on Internet Explorer)
	2. It must not generate any javascript errors when complete


Here is the menu structure to follow

	- Home
	- Products
		- Gidgets
		- Widgets
		- Whosewhatsits
	- About
		- Blog
	- Contact

You can just stick with white text on black backgrounds for the menu and the drop downs, we will be doing more complicated visuals in the coming assignments but we will keep it simple for this one. You can pick any font you want to use, bonus points if you use a Google Font, here is an article about using them https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/getting_started#specifying_font_families_and_styles_in_a_stylesheet_url

here is a good article with some best practices and some examples of drop downs https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/03/designing-drop-down-menus-examples-and-best-practices/


Feel free to ask any questions that may come up, and remember Google is your Friend. Have fun!!
